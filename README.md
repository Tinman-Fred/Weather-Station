This is a simple Temperature and Humidity Weather Station. I plan on adding Barametric Pressure, Rain Guage, Wind speed and Direction. This is an example of the TJC TFT Touchscreen Display Displaying the Temp and Humidity as well as controlling 2 LED's. I have included the Fritzing file, Arduino ino file as well as the TJC HMI and tft files.
